- 👋 Hi, I’m @ptruman
- 👀 I’m interested in creating useful (albeit niche!) solutions for things I find I can't do with an/other app/package easily.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker/GitHub
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my diab project potentially :)

Outside of GitHub I have a Google Sites blog with some articles which may (or likely may not!) be of interest that you can [find here](https://www.gothtech.co.uk).
